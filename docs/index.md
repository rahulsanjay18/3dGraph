# PSU IEEE Cornell Cup Homepage

Hello and welcome to the PSU IEEE Cornell Cup Homepage! We are four students vying for the Cornell Cup, with our project, the 3D Grapher/Holographic Visualizer. This site is mainly to keep up with our progress, and while it is being built, why not check out our application [here](Cornell Cup Project.docx "Application Download"), which gives a pretty decent overview of what we are doing.

Update: we did not end up making it to the next round but the project is going to continue.
